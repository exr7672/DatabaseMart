# DatabaseMart Coupon Code 2026: Affordable VPS Hosting, Enterprise GPU Servers, Dedicated Solutions Starting at $2.99/Month

You know that feeling when you're hunting for hosting and everything seems overpriced or suspiciously cheap? DatabaseMart sits in this interesting middle ground where affordability doesn't automatically mean you're getting screwed over. They've been around since 2005, which in internet years is basically ancient history, and they're still here doing their thing out of Texas data centers.

<img width="3066" height="1423" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b628088-9272-4909-aa84-8a31fb1a4a52" />

Here's the deal with DatabaseMart—they're not trying to be everything to everyone. They focus on VPS, dedicated servers, and GPU hosting with actual American hardware and native US IPs. No fancy global data center network spanning twelve countries. Just solid, straightforward hosting that gets deployed fast and doesn't require you to mortgage your house.

The pricing starts ridiculously low at $2.99 per month for their Express Windows Desktop VPS, and before you ask—no, that's not some bait-and-switch pricing. They're running a New Year sale with up to 57% off on select plans. Their GPU servers range from budget-friendly options under $50 to enterprise-level beasts that'll set you back a few thousand monthly. Different needs, different budgets.

**What Makes DatabaseMart Worth Your Attention**

DatabaseMart operates on a simple philosophy: give people dedicated resources at prices that won't make their accountants cry. They've stripped out the fancy stuff you probably don't need and focused on what actually matters—consistent performance, responsive support, and straightforward billing.

Their infrastructure runs on American-quality hardware in Dallas and Kansas City data centers. Everything gets monitored around the clock, and they claim 99.9% uptime, which honestly should be the baseline for any hosting provider worth considering. What caught my attention is their deployment speed—VPS servers spin up in about 2 minutes, dedicated servers in roughly 20 minutes. That's impressively quick when you need something running yesterday.

The control panel is their own creation, which could go either way, but from what users report, it's actually intuitive. You can manage power settings, reinstall operating systems, handle DNS, and deal with domains without pulling your hair out. They also throw in automated backups, which depending on your plan, run anywhere from every four weeks to bi-weekly.

**Current Promo Codes and Discounts (January 2026)**

Multiple coupon code sites are tracking DatabaseMart deals right now, and here's what's actually active:

DatabaseMart is currently running their **New Year Sale** promotion with significant discounts across various hosting categories. The most aggressive discounts hit VPS plans, with the Express Windows Desktop VPS slashed from $6.99 to $2.99 monthly (57% off), and the Basic Plus Windows Desktop VPS dropped from $16.99 to $9.49 monthly (44% off).

However, the most reliable discounts appear to be the automatic sale pricing already displayed on their website. When checking out, look for the "Add Coupon Code" field where you can test available codes.

**VPS Hosting Plans: Breaking Down the Real Costs**

DatabaseMart's VPS lineup runs on both Linux and Windows, with their Windows Desktop VPS being particularly popular for remote work and RDP access. Here's the actual pricing breakdown:

| Plan | RAM | CPU Cores | Storage | Bandwidth | Regular Price | Sale Price |
|------|-----|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Express Windows Desktop VPS | 4GB | 2 | 60GB SSD | 100Mbps Unmetered | $6.99/mo |  [$2.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Express Plus Windows Desktop VPS | 6GB | 3 | 100GB SSD | 100Mbps Unmetered | - |  [$7.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Basic Windows Desktop VPS | 8GB | 4 | 140GB SSD | 200Mbps Unmetered | - |  [$8.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Basic Plus Windows Desktop VPS | 12GB | 6 | 180GB SSD | 200Mbps Unmetered | $16.99/mo |  [$9.49/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Professional Windows Desktop VPS | 18GB | 8 | 240GB SSD | 300Mbps Unmetered | - |  [$15.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Professional Plus Windows Desktop VPS | 24GB | 8 | 280GB SSD | 300Mbps Unmetered | - |  [$27.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Advanced Windows Desktop VPS | 28GB | 10 | 320GB SSD | 500Mbps Unmetered | - |  [$31.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Advanced Plus Windows Desktop VPS | 32GB | 16 | 400GB SSD | 500Mbps Unmetered | - |  [$51.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |

All VPS plans include Windows 10/11 Evaluation, automated backups, no setup fees, and shared IP by default (dedicated IPs available for $2/month extra). Professional tier and above include 1 dedicated IP standard and more frequent backups every two weeks instead of monthly.

The Linux VPS options run slightly cheaper since there's no Windows licensing overhead. You get root access, choice of Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, or OpenSUSE Leap, and the same dedicated resource allocation. DatabaseMart doesn't charge extra for the Windows license, which is unusual and genuinely saves you money compared to most hosts.

**Dedicated Server Options: When VPS Isn't Enough**

When shared resources won't cut it and you need an entire machine to yourself, DatabaseMart's dedicated server lineup starts at $27 monthly and scales up to enterprise configurations. These are bare metal servers—actual physical hardware with no virtualization overhead.

| Plan | RAM | CPU | Storage | Price | Monthly Cost |
|------|-----|-----|---------|-------|--------------|
| Express Dedicated Server - SSD | 32GB | 4 Cores | 120GB SSD | - |  [$27.00/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Lite Dedicated Server - SSD | 16GB | 4 Cores | 120GB SSD | - |  [$45.00/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Basic Dedicated Server - SSD | 64GB | 8 Cores | 120GB + 960GB SSD | - |  [$43.00/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Professional Dedicated Server - SSD | 128GB | 16 Cores | 240GB + 2TB | - |  [$99.00/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |

Dedicated servers support extensive customization through their add-ons page. You can stack additional NVMe drives (960GB for $9/month, 2TB for $19/month, 4TB for $29/month), extra RAM (ranging from 16GB at $5/month up to 256GB at $49/month), additional dedicated IPs ($2 each), and bandwidth upgrades. There's typically a $39 one-time setup fee for major hardware additions.

The dedicated options shine for database hosting, high-traffic e-commerce platforms, Forex trading servers running MT4/MT5, or any scenario where you need guaranteed resources without noisy neighbors affecting performance.

**GPU Server Hosting: The Real Money Maker**

Here's where DatabaseMart gets interesting. They've built out an extensive GPU server infrastructure with over 21 different GPU card models, ranging from budget GT 710 cards up to enterprise Nvidia H100 and the newly available RTX 5090. This isn't some hobby side project—they're clearly targeting AI/ML workloads, deep learning, 3D rendering, video processing, and high-performance computing.

These GPU servers support popular LLM models including DeepSeek (r1, coder, v2.5, v3), Qwen (2, 2.5, coder), LLaMA (2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3), and Gemma families. They're optimized for hosting large language models ranging from small 0-parameter test models up to massive 405-billion parameter models.

**What Users Actually Say About DatabaseMart**

DatabaseMart holds a 4.1/5 rating on Trustpilot from 196 reviews, which is respectable in the hosting industry where everyone loves to complain. HostAdvice gave them a 9.0/10 overall score after comprehensive testing, with particularly high marks for features (9.2/10) and ease of use (9.5/10).

The positive feedback clusters around a few themes. Users consistently praise the competitive pricing and the value-for-money proposition. One customer mentioned running four VPS instances and one dedicated server across two accounts, specifically noting that "performance is consistent, no throttling, no hidden limits. What I pay for is what I get." That's refreshingly straightforward.

The 24/7 human support gets frequent mentions. People appreciate talking to actual humans instead of chatbots, and response times seem solid. One reviewer from Argentina said their "problem was solved very quickly" and support "responded instantly" to a minor issue. Another from Hong Kong noted customer service rep Jay helped solve "many problems in time."

Performance benchmarks from HostAdvice's independent testing showed impressive numbers: 3.0 GB/s NVMe write speeds, stable 2ms network latency, and strong CPU performance under Prime95 stress testing that maintained 100% utilization without throttling. The server recovered quickly when load dropped, with memory usage falling from 92% to 30% almost immediately.

On the criticism side, WHTop shows a lower 3.3/10 rating with complaints focused mainly on customer service quality and setup times from several years ago. One older review from 2015 complained about security issues, though that's ancient history in technology terms. More recent negative feedback mentions occasional disconnections and GPU driver issues about once monthly that require support intervention.

The mixed reviews seem to reflect that DatabaseMart works really well for certain use cases (budget VPS, GPU computing, straightforward dedicated servers) but might not be the best fit if you need extensive hand-holding or have complex custom requirements. They've optimized for efficiency and cost reduction, which means leaner support compared to premium managed hosts.

**Cloud Hosting and Specialized Applications**

DatabaseMart's cloud hosting takes a different approach than traditional shared hosting. You first select which application you want to run—WordPress, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Magento, PrestaShop, Odoo, ERPNext, and over 50 others—then choose a resource tier based on CPU cores, RAM, and storage.

Taking WordPress as an example, their cloud hosting pricing looks like this:

| Plan | CPU Cores | Memory | Storage | Websites | Backups | Price |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| Express | 2 | 2GB | 60GB SSD | Up to 4 | 2x per month |  [$4.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Basic | 3 | 4GB | 100GB SSD | Up to 8 | 2x per month |  [$8.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Professional | 4 | 8GB | 160GB SSD | Up to 16 | Weekly |  [$15.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |
| Advanced | 6 | 16GB | 240GB SSD | Up to 32 | Weekly |  [$31.99/mo](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) |

All cloud hosting plans include unmetered bandwidth, on-demand backups, and 24/7 technical support. The application-specific approach means the environment comes pre-optimized for whatever you're running, which should theoretically mean better performance than generic shared hosting.

For database hosting specifically, DatabaseMart offers three approaches: fully managed cloud servers starting at $4.99/month for small-to-medium databases, VPS servers starting at $3.59/month for users who want more control, and dedicated servers beginning at $45/month for large-scale database operations. They support SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other major database platforms with automatic backups and high availability configurations.

**AI and Deep Learning Hosting: The Cutting Edge**

DatabaseMart's AI hosting deserves separate attention because they're clearly investing heavily here. They offer dedicated AI hosting plans specifically optimized for machine learning, deep learning, and large language model deployment.

The Enterprise GPU Dedicated Server with A100 runs $719/month and packs 256GB RAM, dual 18-core processors, 120GB SSD + 960GB SSD storage, and the Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPU with 40GB HBM2e memory. This configuration delivers 19.5 TFLOPS of FP32 performance and excels at AI model training and inference tasks.

For organizations running truly massive AI workloads, the Multi-GPU Dedicated Server with 4x A100 currently sits at 👉 [$1,499/month with 40% recurring discount](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) (down from $2,499). This beast includes 512GB RAM, dual 22-core processors, 240GB SSD + 4TB NVMe + 16TB SATA storage, and four A100 GPUs providing combined computational power suitable for the most demanding parallel processing tasks.

They explicitly support popular AI frameworks including Ollama, LLaMA variants, Stable Diffusion, DeepSeek models, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma, Phi, and MiniMax. The GPU servers handle everything from lightweight Android emulators and small language models up to 405-billion parameter behemoths requiring serious hardware.

**Additional Services and Add-Ons Worth Knowing**

DatabaseMart offers extensive customization through their add-ons page. Beyond the basic plans, you can build almost any configuration you need:

**VPS Add-Ons:**
- Additional CPU cores: $2/month per core (up to 16 cores)
- Additional memory: $2/month per GB (up to 32GB)

- Private network: 1Gbps internal port ($10/mo), 10Gbps internal port ($20/mo)
- HDMI dummy plug: $8/month (for specific GPU models requiring display emulation)
- Additional bandwidth and storage options similar to dedicated servers

Most hardware add-ons come with a $39 one-time setup fee to cover installation and configuration. DatabaseMart accepts payment via all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover, Diners Club), PayPal, wire transfer (minimum $100), and US checks. Non-instant payment methods like wire transfers delay service activation until funds clear.

**Free Trial and Money-Back Guarantee**

DatabaseMart offers a 24-hour free trial on many services, letting you test before committing. Their trial program includes:

- Express Windows VPS: 24 hours free, then $2.99/month
- Basic Windows VPS: 24 hours free, then $18.99/month  
- Express Bare Metal: 24 hours free, then $54/month
- Basic Bare Metal: 24 hours free, then $79/month
- Various GPU VPS options: 24 hours free testing

For paid services, they provide a 30-day money-back guarantee covering shared hosting, reseller hosting, and VPS plans. Notably, this guarantee excludes dedicated servers, Microsoft licenses, domain registrations, and SSL certificates. The policy gives you a month to evaluate whether the service meets your needs without financial risk.

**Data Center Locations and Network Infrastructure**

DatabaseMart operates exclusively from United States data centers located in Dallas, Texas and Kansas City. This focused geographic approach means lower latency for North American users but potentially higher latency for international customers.

The US-only approach has advantages: native American IP addresses, straightforward legal jurisdiction, and high-quality hardware that's easier to source and maintain domestically. They emphasize "American Quality" hardware throughout their marketing, and their self-operated data centers mean they control the entire stack from physical machines to network infrastructure.

The network infrastructure includes 100Mbps to 1Gbps connections depending on plan tier, with unmetered bandwidth on most offerings. Their testing showed stable network performance with consistent 2ms ping times to Google, zero packet loss, and reliable throughput. For applications requiring international presence or CDN-level global distribution, you'd need to supplement DatabaseMart hosting with additional services.

**Server Management and Control Panel Experience**

DatabaseMart provides their proprietary control panel rather than cPanel or Plesk, which could be positive or negative depending on your perspective. The control panel interface is reportedly intuitive, with a clean dashboard showing all your active services at a glance.

From the control panel, you can:
- Start, stop, and restart servers with a few clicks
- Reinstall operating systems without support tickets
- Access Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection information
- View and manage server resources (CPU, RAM, disk, bandwidth)
- Configure DNS settings and domain management  
- Monitor server events and logs
- Request dedicated IPs and other upgrades
- Access automated backup settings and on-demand backups

For Windows VPS, you get administrator-level access via Remote Desktop Connection. Linux VPS includes full root access via SSH. GPU servers provide complete control over GPU drivers, CUDA installations, and framework configurations. The level of control sits somewhere between fully managed hosting (where the provider handles everything) and pure infrastructure-as-a-service (where you're completely on your own).

DatabaseMart offers free installation of SolidCP control panel for Windows VPS servers if you prefer that interface for managing IIS websites and MSSQL databases. For Linux users wanting cPanel, they'll install it free but you need to purchase your own cPanel license, which includes a 15-day free trial from cPanel directly.

**Support Quality and Response Times**

Database Mart provides 24/7/365 human support through multiple channels: live chat, email (support@databasemart.com), and ticket system. They explicitly advertise "Full Human Customer Service" with over 60 tech support staff working across different time zones.

Based on independent testing and user reports, support response times break down like this:

- **Live chat:** Responses typically within 9-15 minutes for sales inquiries and urgent technical issues. Live chat is specifically designated for sales questions and emergencies rather than routine technical support.

- **Email support:** Response times around 5-6 hours for detailed technical queries. Responses tend to be comprehensive and address multiple aspects of complex questions.

- **Ticket system:** Similar to email, roughly 5 hours for technical support tickets. The automated acknowledgment arrives immediately, but actual human response takes several hours.

The quality of support appears solid for their price point. Support staff demonstrate technical knowledge about server configurations, database optimization, PHP/MySQL settings, and GPU driver troubleshooting. They provide specific recommendations rather than generic troubleshooting steps.

The support team handles everything from hardware maintenance to operating system troubleshooting to application-level issues. They've logged over 166,320 hours of support time according to their website, and the 19+ years of hosting experience shows in their ability to quickly diagnose and resolve issues.

For users wanting more hands-on assistance, DatabaseMart's support isn't as comprehensive as fully managed hosting providers but exceeds typical unmanaged VPS support. They'll help with server issues, provide configuration guidance, and troubleshoot technical problems, but they won't manage your applications or take over your server administration completely.

**Use Cases: Who Actually Benefits from DatabaseMart**

DatabaseMart hosting makes sense for several specific scenarios:

**Forex Traders:** The low-latency VPS and dedicated servers work well for running MetaTrader 4/5, cTrader, and NinjaTrader platforms 24/7 without interruption. Starting at $2.99/month, you can maintain always-on trading bots and expert advisors without worrying about your home computer crashing or internet dropping.

**AI Researchers and ML Engineers:** The extensive GPU server lineup from budget P600 cards up to enterprise H100 GPUs provides scalable infrastructure for training models, running inference, and experimenting with large language models. The per-month pricing without long-term contracts lets you spin up expensive hardware only when needed.

**Game Server Hosts:** The dedicated resources, US-based low-latency network, and reasonable pricing support game servers for titles requiring persistent worlds or competitive multiplayer where latency matters.

**Remote Workers and Digital Nomads:** The Windows Desktop VPS plans essentially provide a remote computer accessible via RDP from anywhere. At $2.99-51.99 monthly, this beats buying and maintaining physical hardware, especially for travelers.

**Database Administrators:** Whether running MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or other database platforms, the dedicated resource allocation and automated backup systems provide reliability for production databases without enterprise-level costs.

**Content Creators and Video Editors:** GPU servers make remote video editing, 3D rendering, and content creation feasible without investing thousands in local hardware. The RTX 3060 Ti, 4090, and professional Quadro cards handle Adobe Creative Suite, DaVinci Resolve, Blender, and similar applications.

**Web Developers and Agencies:** The VPS and cloud hosting options provide staging and production environments for multiple client sites without breaking the budget. The application-specific cloud hosting (WordPress, Magento, etc.) comes pre-optimized.

DatabaseMart probably isn't ideal if you need extensive white-glove managed services, require global CDN infrastructure, want specialized WordPress hosting with one-click staging, or need enterprise SLAs with guaranteed response times measured in minutes rather than hours.

**How to Actually Order and Get Started**

The ordering process is straightforward:

1. Visit 👉 [DatabaseMart's website](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) and navigate to the hosting category you need (VPS, Dedicated, GPU, Cloud, etc.)

2. Select your specific plan and click "Order Now"

3. Configure your server: choose operating system (Linux distributions or Windows), set server name and password, select billing cycle (monthly, quarterly, annual, or biennial for increasing discounts)

4. Add any optional upgrades: extra bandwidth, database installations, backup services, dedicated IPs, additional storage, etc.

5. Apply any available coupon codes in the designated field

6. Review the order summary showing recurring costs and initial payment

7. Complete checkout with your preferred payment method

8. Receive login credentials via email—usually within 2-20 minutes depending on service type

9. Access your server via the DatabaseMart control panel to manage settings, or connect directly via RDP (Windows) or SSH (Linux)

For GPU servers, you'll receive connection information including IP address, access port, login credentials, and specific GPU configuration details. The control panel provides clear guidance on connecting and getting started.

**The Bottom Line: Is DatabaseMart Worth It in 2026?**

DatabaseMart occupies an interesting niche—affordable hosting with serious hardware for people who need dedicated resources without enterprise budgets. They're not trying to compete with AWS or Google Cloud on global infrastructure. They're not positioning as premium managed WordPress hosts competing with WP Engine or Kinsta. They're straightforward American hosting with fast deployment, dedicated resources, responsive support, and pricing that makes sense for small-to-medium operations.

The VPS plans starting at 👉 [$2.99/month](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) represent genuine value if you need Windows RDP access or Linux root servers. The GPU hosting from budget options under $50 to enterprise H100 servers provides scalability for AI/ML workloads without long-term commitments. Dedicated servers deliver bare metal performance at prices comparable to many VPS providers.

The 20-year track record, 99.9% uptime commitment, 2-minute VPS deployment, and 24/7 human support create a solid foundation. The 30-day money-back guarantee and 24-hour free trials reduce risk. The current New Year Sale with up to 57% off select plans and flash sales running through June 2026 on GPU servers make timing favorable for new customers.

DatabaseMart works best if you're comfortable managing your own servers (even with support available), need US-based hosting with low domestic latency, want dedicated resources without shared hosting variability, or require GPU computing power for specialized workloads. If those match your requirements, DatabaseMart delivers solid value backed by nearly two decades of experience.

For anyone considering GPU servers, AI hosting, Forex VPS, database hosting, or affordable dedicated servers in 2026, DatabaseMart deserves serious evaluation. Start with their 👉 [24-hour free trial](https://www.databasemart.com/?aff_id=ecc029ec410742e693467430d4049713) to test performance before committing, or leverage the 30-day money-back guarantee to evaluate their service risk-free.
